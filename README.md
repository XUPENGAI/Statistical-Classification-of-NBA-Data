# Statistical-Classification-of-NBA-Data
The purpose of this research is to examine the use of different statistical classification methods for predicting the outcome of basketball matches in the National Basketball Association (NBA). Statistical data from 4920 NBA games were collected and used to train and test a variety of classification techniques such as the KNN method and Decision Tree. Classification was chosen as the model to identify new observations as a “Win” or “Loss”. Methods used in this research are the supervised machine learning algorithms K-Nearest Neighbours (KNN) and Decision Trees. The hill climbing method, with random feature selection, was used to determine the value of neighbours and features used in the models. The experiment showed how adding and removing features differed the overall results in the predictability of the outcome of an NBA game via Decision Trees and the K-NN Methods. The K-NN method provided a more accurate predictability in determining the outcome of an NBA basketball match with the Cross validation across five folds of data produced precision ratings between 76 - 79%. Future research could look at analysing individual players and see how their performances influence match outcome.
